## Pokemon Display App

This is an application that displays a list of pokemon returned from a GraphQL API server. Most of the file structure was scaffolded by create-react-app. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run mytest`

Run a simple render test on two display components with Jest

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
